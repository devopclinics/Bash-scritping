# If Statements in Bash Scripting

## Introduction
If statements (and, closely related, case statements) allow us to make decisions in our Bash scripts. They enable us to decide whether or not to run a piece of code based on conditions that we may set.

## Basic Syntax
The basic syntax of an `if` statement in Bash is as follows:
```bash
if [ <some test> ]
then
    <command1>
else
    <command2>
fi
```

- `<some test>`: A condition to test.
- `<command1>`: Command(s) to run if the condition is true.
- `<command2>`: Command(s) to run if the condition is false.

## Example: Basic If Statement

### Script: `if_sample.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Description: Basic if statement example

if [ $1 -gt 100 ]
then
    echo "Hey, that's a large number."
else
    echo "Hey, you are doing good."
fi
```

### Explanation
- The script checks if the first argument passed to the script (`$1`) is greater than 100.
- If the condition is true, it prints "Hey, that's a large number."
- If the condition is false, it prints "Hey, you are doing good."

### Running the Script
1. **Create the script file:**
    ```bash
    touch if_sample.sh
    ```

2. **Give execute permission to the file:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x if_sample.sh
    ```

3. **Edit the script file:**
    ```bash
    vim if_sample.sh
    ```

4. **Insert the script and save the file:**
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # Description: Basic if statement example

    if [ $1 -gt 100 ]
    then
        echo "Hey, that's a large number."
    else
        echo "Hey, you are doing good."
    fi
    ```
    - In `vim`, press `i` to insert the commands.
    - Save and quit `vim` by pressing `Esc` and typing `:wq`.

5. **Run the script with an argument:**
    ```bash
    ./if_sample.sh 150
    ./if_sample.sh 50
    ```

## Common Test Operators
Here are some common test operators used in `if` statements:

| Operator              | Description                                         |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `! EXPRESSION`        | The EXPRESSION is false.                            |
| `-n STRING`           | The length of STRING is greater than zero.          |
| `-z STRING`           | The length of STRING is zero (i.e., it is empty).   |
| `STRING1 = STRING2`   | STRING1 is equal to STRING2.                        |
| `STRING1 != STRING2`  | STRING1 is not equal to STRING2.                    |
| `INTEGER1 -eq INTEGER2` | INTEGER1 is numerically equal to INTEGER2.         |
| `INTEGER1 -gt INTEGER2` | INTEGER1 is numerically greater than INTEGER2.     |
| `INTEGER1 -lt INTEGER2` | INTEGER1 is numerically less than INTEGER2.        |
| `-d FILE`             | FILE exists and is a directory.                    |
| `-e FILE`             | FILE exists.                                       |
| `-f FILE`             | FILE exists and is a regular file.                 |
| `-r FILE`             | FILE exists and the read permission is granted.    |
| `-s FILE`             | FILE exists and its size is greater than zero.     |
| `-w FILE`             | FILE exists and the write permission is granted.   |
| `-x FILE`             | FILE exists and the execute permission is granted. |

## Example: Testing Conditions

### Checking if a String is Not Empty
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Description: Test if a string is not empty

STR="Hello"
if [ -n "$STR" ]
then
    echo "The string is not empty."
else
    echo "The string is empty."
fi
```

### Checking if Two Strings are Equal
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Description: Test if two strings are equal

STR1="Hello"
STR2="World"
if [ "$STR1" = "$STR2" ]

fi
```

### Checking if a File Exists
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Description: Test if a file exists

FILE="myfile.txt"
